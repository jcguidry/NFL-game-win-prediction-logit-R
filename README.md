## Features
- Logistic regression model for game outcome prediction
- Extensive creation of features, using cumulative season statistics
    - For first game of each season, stats from last season are used
- Comprehensive analysis and report on how variables impact win probability
- Combination of logic and documentation, enabled by .RMD format

## Requirements
- R (latest version recommended)
- Pandoc (for rendering PDFs)
